            Sublet Shark is an application intended to provide a post-secondary student-centric 
            sublet finding platform. In broad terms, Sublet Shark aims to eliminate the layers 
            of landlords and leasing agents from the process of finding affordable, 
            short-term housing for students in university towns. Sublet Shark is
            developed by students, for students, with ease-of-use in mind.

            The developers of Sublet Shark are students who have faced the housing
            Facebook groups and the leasing sites term after term, and are sick of 
            keeping track of listings on multiple platforms, while communicating 
            with apathetic leasing agents and landlords through email. Account creation is 
            exclusively available to students, and listings displayed on Sublet Shark 
            are personally vetted, to ensure they are accurate and complete. We focus on 
            the ease-of-use of our platform by building intuitive interfaces that compliment
            our purpose.
