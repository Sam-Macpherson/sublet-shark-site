# 🦈 Sublet Shark 
##### https://subletshark.ca

Sublet Shark is an application intended to provide a post-secondary student-centric 
sublet finding platform. In broad terms, Sublet Shark aims to eliminate the layers 
of landlords and leasing agents from the process of finding affordable, 
short-term housing for students in university towns. Sublet Shark is
developed by students, for students, with ease-of-use in mind.

#### 🎓 Emphasis on students
Sublet Shark **is**:
* For post-secondary students looking for short term accommodation near 
their institution
* For post-secondary students looking to sublet their room/apartment to 
another local student

Sublet Shark **is not** :
* For leases
* For landlords or leasing agents, or anyone who isn't a student
* For long-term rental arrangements

#### ☑️ Commitment to quality
The developers of Sublet Shark are students who have faced the housing
Facebook groups and the leasing sites term after term, and are sick of 
keeping track of listings on multiple platforms, while communicating 
with apathetic leasing agents and landlords through email. Account creation is 
exclusively available to students, and listings displayed on Sublet Shark 
are personally vetted, to ensure they are accurate and complete. We focus on 
the ease-of-use of our platform by building intuitive interfaces that compliment
our purpose.


Sublet Shark is currently in development, but we hope to release something as
soon as possible.
